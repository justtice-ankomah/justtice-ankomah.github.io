if a specific topic is so hard to learn like spring security?
Simply divided it into small part and learn each one seperately and later combine them all.

so with spring secuity, you can learn: 
Userdetails first,
authenticationManager second, 
AuthenticatioFilter third
userdetailsService fourth,

And then with good understanding of all above, you can finally combine them both to work on a project.

======================================


What website or app at all Do tech companies want to build that never exist?

So just develop a clone of other popular website like twitter, reddit, youtube, facebook, quora etc. 
And just add it to your resume or as a project for applying for Job.

If you can't develop a clone of a specific website, just develop the front-end or back-end. But it would be better to do everthing.
