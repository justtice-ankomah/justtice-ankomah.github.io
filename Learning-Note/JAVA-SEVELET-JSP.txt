SERVLET

NOTE = To create any file for your project, just righ click on the project name and choose the type of project you wan to creat.

* To create a SERVLET::
create a java class and extend Servlet class. then create 2 public void method handle GET and Post Request. the method name should be doPost and do Get if not an error will happen.. example

	public void doPost(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {
		
		int num1 =Integer.parseInt( req.getParameter("num1"));
		int num2 =Integer.parseInt( req.getParameter("num2"));
		int sum = num1 + num2;
		PrintWriter out = res.getWriter();
		out.println("The sum is: " + sum);
		
	}
	
	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest req, HttpServletResponse res) throws IOException {
		PrintWriter out = res.getWriter();
		out.println("get method executed");
	} 

How to map a form to specific Java sevelet class. Inside Webcontent->WEB-INF->web.xml:

give your servlet a name and identify it class and then map a specific url to it. 

  <servlet>
    <servlet-name>addform</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>com.packagename.mysevlet</servlet-class>
  </servlet>

  <servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>addform</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/add</url-pattern>
  </servlet-mapping>

1.inside the servlet <servlet-name>, give any name you want to identify your servlet name. this is becuase you may have many servlet and each should be identified by a unique name

2. inside the servlet  <servlet-class> tell your server where your class is. It should be in full-qualified-name that is (the package name + class name)

3. inside the servlet-mapping  <servlet-name> tell your server which servlet you want to mapp a certain url to. (that is the name in servlet <servlet-name>)

4. inside the servlet-mapping  <url-pattern> give a uniqe url to your servelet so that you can use that url in html.

IN JSP:::
inside <%= %> is where you pring out a file to the screen. 
<%= new java.util.Date() %>

<% ...code %> === for adding many java code in it. if you want to output anything you use out.println();

<%! ...code %> === fro varible declaration and methods. Then call such methods or variable in <%= ... %>



(*)To import external java package to jsp file, before <html> add::
<%@ page import="pakcagename.*"%>
