Exception handling in java:::

1. define a method that throws some execption.

public void book() throws someException{
  //exceptions goes here
}

Now any code that needs to use the above method "book()" needs to handle the exception. 
The way we handle exception is by wrapping it in a try, catch, final block.

try{
   book();
}
catch(someException e){
  system.out.println(e.stactTrace());
}
finally{
system.out.println("i will execute no-matter what");
}

the "finally" is optional, is for executing code either error happends or not. 

"TRY" means, thry this code "book()" if there is an error, execute the code in "catch". and if nothing happens move on don't execute "catch"

"CATCH" means, run the code in "TRY" if only some error occur, catch it and execute the code in the "CATCH" block.

"FINALLY" means, hei me i don't care, if error happen in try or not execute me.
